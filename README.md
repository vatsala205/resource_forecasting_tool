Perfect! Starting with the **Resource Allocation & Load Forecasting Tool** is a smart choice for your Airtel internship — it’s data-driven, directly relevant to telecom strategy, and scalable.

Here’s a **step-by-step roadmap** to get you started:

---

## 🔧 Phase 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing

### ✅ Dataset: Use the census data you shared (villages, towns, population, area, etc.)

### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Convert the data to a **structured CSV/Excel/SQL** format.
* Clean column names (e.g., remove slashes/extra quotes).
* Normalize units (e.g., area in sq. km).
* Create derived columns like:

  * **Population density** = Population / Area
  * **Households per sq. km**
  * **Urbanization level** = Towns / (Towns + Villages)

---

## 📊 Phase 2: Feature Engineering

### 🏗️ Build Features Like:

* State/Region rural-urban ratio
* Population growth rate (if historical data is added)
* Households per town/village
* Uninhabited vs inhabited ratio

---

## 🤖 Phase 3: Build the Forecasting Model

### 🎯 Goal: Predict **resource demand index** for each region (proxy for telecom load)

### Model Ideas:

* **Regression models** to predict:

  * Estimated network usage
  * Estimated tower requirement
* Use `Linear Regression`, `Random Forest`, or `XGBoost` for interpretable results.

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: AI Layer for Insights

* Use clustering (e.g., **K-Means**) to group similar districts.
* Use classification (e.g., Decision Trees) to flag **high-priority areas** for infrastructure upgrades.

---

## 🗺️ Phase 5: Visualization

### Tools:

* **Streamlit / Dash / Power BI** for dashboards
* **Folium / Plotly / GeoPandas** to map regions with:

  * Population density heatmaps
  * Predicted demand overlays

---

## 🚀 Bonus: Airtel-Specific Tie-In

* If you get access to **network usage or subscriber data**, use it to:

  * Validate your model
  * Correlate household/population data with real load
